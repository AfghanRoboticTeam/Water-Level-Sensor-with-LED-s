Components Needed:

Arduino Uno

Water Level Sensor (e.g., a resistive water level sensor)

3 LEDs (different colors to represent different levels)

3 Resistors (220Ω for each LED)

Connecting wires

Breadboard



Circuit Diagram:

Water Level Sensor: Connect the sensor’s signal output to an analog input pin on the Arduino (e.g., A0).

LEDs: Connect the LEDs to digital output pins (e.g., 7, 8, 9) with resistors in series to limit the current.

LED1 (Low Level) → Pin 7

LED2 (Medium Level) → Pin 8

LED3 (High Level) → Pin 9

The other legs of the LEDs go to ground.
